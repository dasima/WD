The
Old
Testament
GENESIS
Genesis
In
the
beginning
God
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
And
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
And
the
Spirit
of
God
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
And
God
said
Let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
And
God
saw
the
light
that
it
was
good
and
God
divided
the
light
from
the
darkness
And
God
called
the
light
Day
and
the
darkness
he
called
Night
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
And
God
said
Let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters
And
God
made
the
firmament
and
divided
the
waters
which
were
under
the
firmament
from
the
waters
which
were
above
the
firmament
and
it
was
so
And
God
called
the
firmament
Heaven
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
second
day
And
God
said
Let
the
waters
under
the
heaven
be
gathered
together
unto
one
place
and
let
the
dry
land
appear
and
it
was
so
And
God
called
the
dry
land
Earth
and
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
called
he
Seas
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good
And
God
said
Let
the
earth
bring
forth
grass
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
fruit
tree
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind
whose
seed
is
in
itself
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
so
And
the
earth
brought
forth
grass
and
herb
yielding
seed
after
his
kind
and
the
tree
yielding
fruit
whose
seed
was
in
itself
after
his
kind
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
third
day
And
God
said
Let
there
be
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
divide
the
day
from
the
night
and
let
them
be
for
signs
and
for
seasons
and
for
days
and
years
And
let
them
be
for
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
so
And
God
made
two
great
lights
the
greater
light
to
rule
the
day
and
the
lesser
light
to
rule
the
night
he
made
the
stars
also
And
God
set
them
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
And
to
rule
over
the
day
and
over
the
night
and
to
divide
the
light
from
the
darkness
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fourth
day
And
God
said
Let
the
waters
bring
forth
abundantly
the
moving
creature
that
hath
life
and
fowl
that
may
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven
And
God
created
great
whales
and
every
living
creature
that
moveth
which
the
waters
brought
forth
abundantly
after
their
kind
and
every
winged
fowl
after
his
kind
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good
And
God
blessed
them
saying
Be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
fill
the
waters
in
the
seas
and
let
fowl
multiply
in
the
earth
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fifth
day
And
God
said
Let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
cattle
and
creeping
thing
and
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
it
was
so
And
God
made
the
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
cattle
after
their
kind
and
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
God
saw
that
it
was
good
And
God
said
Let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
So
God
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
God
created
he
him
male
and
female
created
he
them
And
God
blessed
them
and
God
said
unto
them
Be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
And
God
said
Behold
I
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
in
the
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
yielding
seed
to
you
it
shall
be
for
meat
And
to
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
wherein
there
is
life
I
have
given
every
green
herb
for
meat
and
it
was
so
And
God
saw
every
thing
that
he
had
made
and
behold
it
was
very
good
And
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
sixth
day
Genesis
Thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
and
all
the
host
of
them
And
on
the
seventh
day
God
ended
his
work
which
he
had
made
and
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
work
which
he
had
made
And
God
blessed
the
seventh
day
and
sanctified
it
because
that
in
it
he
had
rested
from
all
his
work
which
God
created
and
made
These
are
the
generations
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
when
they
were
created
in
the
day
that
the
LORD
God
made
the
earth
and
the
heavens
And
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
and
every
herb
of
the
field
before
it
grew
for
the
LORD
God
had
not
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
and
there
was
not
a
man
to
till
the
ground
But
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
and
watered
the
whole
face
of
the
ground
And
the
LORD
God
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
soul
And
the
LORD
God
planted
a
garden
eastward
in
Eden
and
there
he
put
the
man
whom
he
had
formed
And
out
of
the
ground
made
the
LORD
God
to
grow
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food
the
tree
of
life
also
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
and
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
And
a
river
went
out
of
Eden
to
water
the
garden
and
from
thence
it
was
parted
and
became
into
four
heads
The
name
of
the
first
is
Pison
that
is
it
which
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
Havilah
where
there
is
gold
And
the
gold
of
that
land
is
good
there
is
bdellium
and
the
onyx
stone
And
the
name
of
the
second
river
is
Gihon
the
same
is
it
that
compasseth
the
whole
land
of
Ethiopia
Genesis
And
God
said
unto
Jacob
Arise
go
up
to
Bethel
and
dwell
there
and
make
there
an
altar
unto
God
that
appeared
unto
thee
when
thou
fleddest
from
the
face
of
Esau
thy
brother
Then
Jacob
said
unto
his
household
and
to
all
that
were
with
him
Put
away
the
strange
gods
that
are
among
you
and
be
clean
and
change
your
garments
And
let
us
arise
and
go
up
to
Bethel
and
I
will
make
there
an
altar
unto
God
who
answered
me
in
the
day
of
my
distress
and
was
with
me
in
the
way
which
I
went
And
they
gave
unto
Jacob
all
the
strange
gods
which
were
in
their
hand
and
all
their
earrings
which
were
in
their
ears
and
Jacob
hid
them
under
the
oak
which
was
by
Shechem
And
they
journeyed
and
the
terror
of
God
was
upon
the
cities
that
were
round
about
them
and
they
did
not
pursue
after
the
sons
of
Jacob
So
Jacob
came
to
Luz
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan
that
is
Bethel
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
And
he
built
there
an
altar
and
called
the
place
Elbethel
because
there
God
appeared
unto
him
when
he
fled
from
the
face
of
his
brother
But
Deborah
Rebekahs
nurse
died
and
she
was
buried
beneath
Bethel
under
an
oak
and
the
name
of
it
was
called
Allonbachuth
And
God
appeared
unto
Jacob
again
when
he
came
out
of
Padanaram
and
blessed
him
And
God
said
unto
him
Thy
name
is
Jacob
thy
name
shall
not
be
called
any
more
Jacob
but
Israel
shall
be
thy
name
and
he
called
his
name
Israel
And
God
said
unto
him
I
am
God
Almighty
be
fruitful
and
multiply
a
nation
and
a
company
of
nations
shall
be
of
thee
and
kings
shall
come
out
of
thy
loins
And
the
land
which
I
gave
Abraham
and
Isaac
to
thee
I
will
give
it
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
will
I
give
the
land
And
God
went
up
from
him
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him
And
Jacob
set
up
a
pillar
in
the
place
where
he
talked
with
him
even
a
pillar
of
stone
and
he
poured
a
drink
offering
thereon
and
he
poured
oil
thereon
And
Jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
where
God
spake
with
him
Bethel
And
they
journeyed
from
Bethel
and
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
to
Ephrath
and
Rachel
travailed
and
she
had
hard
labour
And
it
came
to
pass
when
she
was
in
hard
labour
that
the
midwife
said
unto
her
Fear
not
thou
shalt
have
this
son
also
And
it
came
to
pass
as
her
soul
was
in
departing
for
she
died
that
she
called
his
name
Benoni
but
his
father
called
him
Benjamin
And
Joshua
discomfited
Amalek
and
his
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses
Write
this
for
a
memorial
in
a
book
and
rehearse
it
in
the
ears
of
Joshua
for
I
will
utterly
put
out
the
remembrance
of
Amalek
from
under
heaven
And
Moses
built
an
altar
and
called
the
name
of
it
Jehovahnissi
For
he
said
Because
the
LORD
hath
sworn
that
the
LORD
will
have
war
with
Amalek
from
generation
to
generation
Exodus
When
Jethro
the
priest
of
Midian
Moses
father
in
law
heard
of
all
that
God
had
done
for
Moses
and
for
Israel
his
people
and
that
the
LORD
had
brought
Israel
out
of
Egypt
Then
Jethro
Moses
father
in
law
took
Zipporah
Moses
wife
after
he
had
sent
her
back
And
her
two
sons
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
Gershom
for
he
said
I
have
been
an
alien
in
a
strange
land
And
the
name
of
the
other
was
Eliezer
for
the
God
of
my
father
said
he
was
mine
help
and
delivered
me
from
the
sword
of
Pharaoh
And
Jethro
Moses
father
in
law
came
with
his
sons
and
his
wife
unto
Moses
into
the
wilderness
where
he
encamped
at
the
mount
of
God
And
he
said
unto
Moses
I
thy
father
in
law
Jethro
am
come
unto
thee
and
thy
wife
and
her
two
sons
with
her
And
Moses
went
out
to
meet
his
father
in
law
and
did
obeisance
and
kissed
him
and
they
asked
each
other
of
their
welfare
and
they
came
into
the
tent
And
Moses
told
his
father
in
law
all
that
the
LORD
had
done
unto
Pharaoh
and
to
the
Egyptians
for
Israels
sake
and
all
the
travail
that
had
come
upon
them
by
the
way
and
how
the
LORD
delivered
them
And
Jethro
rejoiced
for
all
the
goodness
which
the
LORD
had
done
to
Israel
whom
he
had
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians
And
the
Levites
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
whosoever
else
cometh
into
the
house
he
shall
be
put
to
death
but
be
ye
with
the
king
when
he
cometh
in
and
when
he
goeth
out
So
the
Levites
and
all
Judah
did
according
to
all
things
that
Jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded
and
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath
with
them
that
were
to
go
out
on
the
sabbath
for
Jehoiada
the
priest
dismissed
not
the
courses
Moreover
Jehoiada
the
priest
delivered
to
the
captains
of
hundreds
spears
and
bucklers
and
shields
that
had
been
king
Davids
which
were
in
the
house
of
God
And
he
set
all
the
people
every
man
having
his
weapon
in
his
hand
from
the
right
side
of
the
temple
to
the
left
side
of
the
temple
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple
by
the
king
round
about
Then
they
brought
out
the
kings
son
and
put
upon
him
the
crown
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
made
him
king
And
Jehoiada
and
his
sons
anointed
him
and
said
God
save
the
king
Now
when
Athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
running
and
praising
the
king
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
house
of
the
LORD
And
she
looked
and
behold
the
king
stood
at
his
pillar
at
the
entering
in
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpets
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
sounded
with
trumpets
also
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick
and
such
as
taught
to
sing
praise
Then
Athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
said
Treason
Treason
Then
Jehoiada
the
priest
brought
out
the
captains
of
hundreds
that
were
set
over
the
host
and
said
unto
them
Have
her
forth
of
the
ranges
and
whoso
followeth
her
let
him
be
slain
with
the
sword
For
the
priest
said
Slay
her
not
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
So
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
when
she
was
come
to
the
entering
of
the
horse
gate
by
the
kings
house
they
slew
her
there
And
Jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
him
and
between
all
the
people
and
between
the
king
that
they
should
be
the
LORDS
people
Then
all
the
people
went
to
the
house
of
Baal
and
brake
it
down
and
brake
his
altars
and
his
images
in
pieces
and
slew
Mattan
the
priest
of
Baal
before
the
altars
Also
Jehoiada
appointed
the
offices
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
by
the
hand
of
the
priests
the
Levites
whom
David
had
distributed
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
to
offer
the
burnt
offerings
of
the
LORD
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
Moses
with
rejoicing
and
with
singing
as
it
was
ordained
by
David
And
he
set
the
porters
at
the
gates
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
that
none
which
was
unclean
in
any
thing
should
enter
in
And
he
took
the
captains
of
hundreds
and
the
nobles
and
the
governors
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
they
came
through
the
high
gate
into
the
kings
house
and
set
the
king
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
And
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
after
that
they
had
slain
Athaliah
with
the
sword
Chronicles
Joash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
forty
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
also
was
Zibiah
of
Beersheba
And
Joash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
And
Jehoiada
took
for
him
two
wives
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
And
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
Joash
was
minded
to
repair
the
house
of
the
LORD
And
he
gathered
together
the
priests
and
the
Levites
and
said
to
them
Go
out
unto
the
cities
of
Judah
and
gather
of
all
Israel
money
to
repair
the
house
of
your
God
from
year
to
year
and
see
that
ye
hasten
the
matter
Howbeit
the
Levites
hastened
it
not
And
the
king
called
for
Jehoiada
the
chief
and
said
unto
him
Why
hast
thou
not
required
of
the
Levites
to
bring
in
out
of
Judah
and
out
of
Jerusalem
the
collection
according
to
the
commandment
of
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
and
of
the
congregation
of
Israel
for
the
tabernacle
of
witness
For
the
sons
of
Athaliah
that
wicked
woman
had
broken
up
the
house
of
God
and
also
all
the
dedicated
things
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
did
they
bestow
upon
Baalim
And
at
the
kings
commandment
they
made
a
chest
and
set
it
without
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
And
they
made
a
proclamation
through
Judah
and
Jerusalem
to
bring
in
to
the
LORD
the
collection
that
Moses
the
servant
of
God
laid
upon
Israel
in
the
wilderness
And
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
and
brought
in
and
cast
into
the
chest
until
they
had
made
an
end
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
at
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
kings
office
by
the
hand
of
the
Levites
and
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
the
kings
scribe
and
the
high
priests
officer
came
and
emptied
the
chest
and
took
it
and
carried
it
to
his
place
again
Thus
they
did
day
by
day
and
gathered
money
in
abundance
And
the
king
and
Jehoiada
gave
it
to
such
as
did
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
hired
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
also
such
as
wrought
iron
and
brass
to
mend
the
house
of
the
LORD
Son
of
man
I
have
broken
the
arm
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
lo
it
shall
not
be
bound
up
to
be
healed
to
put
a
roller
to
bind
it
to
make
it
strong
to
hold
the
sword
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
Behold
I
am
against
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
will
break
his
arms
the
strong
and
that
which
was
broken
and
I
will
cause
the
sword
to
fall
out
of
his
hand
And
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations
and
will
disperse
them
through
the
countries
And
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
put
my
sword
in
his
hand
but
I
will
break
Pharaohs
arms
and
he
shall
groan
before
him
with
the
groanings
of
a
deadly
wounded
man
But
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
the
arms
of
Pharaoh
shall
fall
down
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
when
I
shall
put
my
sword
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
shall
stretch
it
out
upon
the
land
of
Egypt
And
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
countries
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
Ezekiel
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
third
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
saying
Son
of
man
speak
unto
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
to
his
multitude
Whom
art
thou
like
in
thy
greatness
Behold
the
Assyrian
was
a
cedar
in
Lebanon
with
fair
branches
and
with
a
shadowing
shroud
and
of
an
high
stature
and
his
top
was
among
the
thick
boughs
The
waters
made
him
great
the
deep
set
him
up
on
high
with
her
rivers
running
round
about
his
plants
and
sent
out
her
little
rivers
unto
all
the
trees
of
the
field
Therefore
his
height
was
exalted
above
all
the
trees
of
the
field
and
his
boughs
were
multiplied
and
his
branches
became
long
because
of
the
multitude
of
waters
when
he
shot
forth
All
the
fowls
of
heaven
made
their
nests
in
his
boughs
and
under
his
branches
did
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
bring
forth
their
young
and
under
his
shadow
dwelt
all
great
nations
Thus
was
he
fair
in
his
greatness
in
the
length
of
his
branches
for
his
root
was
by
great
waters
The
cedars
in
the
garden
of
God
could
not
hide
him
the
fir
trees
were
not
like
his
boughs
and
the
chesnut
trees
were
not
like
his
branches
nor
any
tree
in
the
garden
of
God
was
like
unto
him
in
his
beauty
I
have
made
him
fair
by
the
multitude
of
his
branches
so
that
all
the
trees
of
Eden
that
were
in
the
garden
of
God
envied
him
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
Because
thou
hast
lifted
up
thyself
in
height
and
he
hath
shot
up
his
top
among
the
thick
boughs
and
his
heart
is
lifted
up
in
his
height
I
have
therefore
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
mighty
one
of
the
heathen
he
shall
surely
deal
with
him
I
have
driven
him
out
for
his
wickedness
And
strangers
the
terrible
of
the
nations
have
cut
him
off
and
have
left
him
upon
the
mountains
and
in
all
the
valleys
his
branches
are
fallen
and
his
boughs
are
broken
by
all
the
rivers
of
the
land
and
all
the
people
of
the
earth
are
gone
down
from
his
shadow
and
have
left
him
Upon
his
ruin
shall
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
remain
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
upon
his
branches
To
the
end
that
none
of
all
the
trees
by
the
waters
exalt
themselves
for
their
height
neither
shoot
up
their
top
among
the
thick
boughs
neither
their
trees
stand
up
in
their
height
all
that
drink
water
for
they
are
all
delivered
unto
death
to
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
men
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
In
the
day
when
he
went
down
to
the
grave
I
caused
a
mourning
I
covered
the
deep
for
him
and
I
restrained
the
floods
thereof
and
the
great
waters
were
stayed
and
I
caused
Lebanon
to
mourn
for
him
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
fainted
for
him
I
made
the
nations
to
shake
at
the
sound
of
his
fall
when
I
cast
him
down
to
hell
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit
and
all
the
trees
of
Eden
the
choice
and
best
of
Lebanon
all
that
drink
water
shall
be
comforted
in
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
They
also
went
down
into
hell
with
him
unto
them
that
be
slain
with
the
sword
and
they
that
were
his
arm
that
dwelt
under
his
shadow
in
the
midst
of
the
heathen
To
whom
art
thou
thus
like
in
glory
and
in
greatness
among
the
trees
of
Eden
yet
shalt
thou
be
brought
down
with
the
trees
of
Eden
unto
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword
This
is
Pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude
saith
the
Lord
GOD
Ezekiel
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
in
the
twelfth
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
me
saying
Son
of
man
take
up
a
lamentation
for
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
say
unto
him
Thou
art
like
a
young
lion
of
the
nations
and
thou
art
as
a
whale
in
the
seas
and
thou
camest
forth
with
thy
rivers
and
troubledst
the
waters
with
thy
feet
and
fouledst
their
rivers
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
I
will
therefore
spread
out
my
net
over
thee
with
a
company
of
many
people
and
they
shall
bring
thee
up
in
my
net
Then
will
I
leave
thee
upon
the
land
I
will
cast
thee
forth
upon
the
open
field
and
will
cause
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
to
remain
upon
thee
and
I
will
fill
the
beasts
of
the
whole
earth
with
thee
And
I
will
lay
thy
flesh
upon
the
mountains
and
fill
the
valleys
with
thy
height
I
will
also
water
with
thy
blood
the
land
wherein
thou
swimmest
even
to
the
mountains
and
the
rivers
shall
be
full
of
thee
And
when
I
shall
put
thee
out
I
will
cover
the
heaven
and
make
the
stars
thereof
dark
I
will
cover
the
sun
with
a
cloud
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
All
the
bright
lights
of
heaven
will
I
make
dark
over
thee
and
set
darkness
upon
thy
land
saith
the
Lord
GOD
I
will
also
vex
the
hearts
of
many
people
when
I
shall
bring
thy
destruction
among
the
nations
into
the
countries
which
thou
hast
not
known
