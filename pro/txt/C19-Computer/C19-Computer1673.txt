On Liveness and Safeness for Weighted Extended Free Choice Nets

Abstract　Liveness and safeness are important behavioral properties of nets (systems).Many powerful results have been derived for some subclasses of Place/Transition nets (systems).The aim of this paper is to draw a general perspective of the liveness and safeness for a subclass with Extended Free Choice net-like underlying graph but allowing weights:Weighted Extended Free Choice nets (WEFC nets).First,a brief and intuitive proof of liveness equivalent condition for WEFC nets is given.Then,for safe nets,a sufficient and necessary condition is presented.
　Key words　Weighted extended free choice net,live,safe,structurally live,structurally safe.
　　Place/Transition net (P/T net)［1］ is a mathematical tool well suited for modelling and analyzing systems exhibiting behaviors such as concurrency,conflict and causal dependency between events.However,the high degree of complexity of the analysis limits the applicability of Petri nets to real-world problems.The reachability graph of such systems is actually unmanageable,thus it is crucial to enforce the analysis power of techniques based on the net structure.This paper presents new results in this direction.
　　Liveness and safeness are main behavioral properties of P/T nets.Liveness corresponds to the absence of global or local deadlock situations,safeness to the absence of overflows.Many results of liveness and safeness theory have been derived for restricted classes of P/T nets［2～6］,due to the use of some graph theoretic tools.We wondered how much it would change if we allow weights in the model.We consider the so-call WEFC nets (weighted extended free choice nets),that generalize the well known class of Extended Free Choice nets.In this paper,we first give an interesting simple proof to the liveness theorem (A WEFC net is live if and only if every subsystem generated by siphon is live).Then,for Safe WEFC nets,we give an equivalent condition.
　　The paper is organized as follows.The next section presents the basic concepts and notations.In section 2,the liveness for the WEFC nets is investigated.In section 3,we present a sufficient and necessary condition of (structure) liveness and (structure) safeness in WEFC nets.Section 4 concludes the paper.
1　Basic Concepts
　　We assume the reader is familiar with the structure,firing rule and basic properties of net models［7］,and with elementary graph theory.However,in this section we recall some basic concepts and notations to be used.
　　Definition 1.1.
　　1.A (Petri) net is a triple N=(P,T;F) where
　　(1) P={p1,p2,...,pm} is a finite set of places,
　　(2) T={t1,t2,...,tn} is a finite set of transitions,
　　(3) F
